/*
6. Create a class called BiggerNum, write a program that checks for the bigger of 3 numbers.

        you get 3 int variables with DIFFERENT values: n1 , n2 and n3

            if n1 is biggest output: "n1 is bigger"
            if n2 is biggest output: "n2 is bigger"
            if n3 is biggest output: "n3 is bigger"
